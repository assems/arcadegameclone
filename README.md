## Description

This is the classic arcade game clone project, made by Assem Said as a required project in Udacity's Front-End Web Development Nanodegree using JavaScript. 

## How to play

In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water using arrow keys on the keyboard, without colliding into any one of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the scene. Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water the game is won.
